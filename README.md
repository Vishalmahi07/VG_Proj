Face Emotion Detection (using Python):

Basic defination:
Face emotion detection refers to the process of identifying and categorizing the emotional state of a person based on their facial expressions. This involves analyzing the facial features and expressions captured in an image or video to determine emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, disgust, or neutral.

How this Emotion Detection works ?

1. Preprocessing: The image or video frame is preprocessed to improve the accuracy of detection. This might include converting the image to grayscale, normalizing lighting conditions, and resizing.

2. Face Detection: Techniques like Haar cascades, DNN models, or MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) are used to locate faces in the image.
Feature Extraction: Once faces are detected, the system extracts relevant features from the facial expressions. This can involve detecting changes in facial landmarks or using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to capture more complex patterns.

3.Emotion Recognition: The extracted features are fed into an emotion classification model, which predicts the emotional state. This model might be a neural network trained on a dataset of labeled facial expressions.


Output: The system provides the predicted emotion, which can be displayed or used for further processing.


The function of 'DetectionModule.py'
The function DetectionModule is designed to detect and analyze emotions from either a video file or a live camera feed. It uses OpenCV for face detection and the DeepFace library for emotion analysis.
